	<p> Software Engineer Summer Intern </p>
    <p> Interned on the data reporting team, which analyzed company and user metrics data to help make informed business decisions. Worked on extracting, transforming, and loading a newly created dataset and helped create multiple autonomous scripts to enhance parts of the current workflow. Mainly learned how to utilize languages: PySpark, Python, and SQL. Developed backend and frontend skills using Scala and AngularJS during an intern-wide project. </p>

	<p> Treobytes </p>
	<p> Facilitator </p>
    <p> Over the course of a year, taught K-12 students in underprivileged areas skills in Scratch, TinkerCAD, and SonicPi. Each session would involve 1 hour sessions developing a certain skill in each of the respective technologies. Usually this would include a fun task, such as learning how to model a 3D boat in TinkerCAD, then testing that model the following week - or completing a challenge game in Scratch. I wanted to teach these kids to help empower them with creative problem solving skills and introduce them to technology that would otherwise be easily accessible in these areas. While teaching, I learned valuable speaking skills as well as how to properly convey high level topics in a simple and concise way such that a 2nd to 8th grader could understand. </p>
