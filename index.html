		<div class="project_names"> Lagrange Relaxation </div>
		<p> Current work in progress. Exploring Langraging Relaxation to solve NP-Complete scheduling problems that rely on multiple conditions. Example: prioritizing which tasks to complete given a certain amount of bandwidth and each task has a due date and importance value. </p>

		<div class="project_names">  Scheduling </div>
		<p> Work In Progress. Utilizing Google's Calendar API to create a bot to manually schedule and list out current events on my Google Calendar. Plan on creating this project into an Alexa Skill</p>

	<div class="fade"> 
		<div class="project_names">  Alexa - Read Reddit </div>
		<p> An Alexa skills application to read reddit post given a particular subreddit thread. Learned how to working with voice activation commands and how to design a clean UI. Plan on adding video and audio functionality per reddit post. </p>

		<div class="project_names">  Zerg Rush </div>
		<p> Creating an artificial intelligence bot to play Starcraft 2 at a high level, using the python-sc2 library. The bot currently focuses on maximizing macro play, such as auto-drone, auto-unsupply-block, and auto-expand.</p>

		<div class="project_names">  MIT Battlehack West </div>
		<div class="project_date"> July 2018 </div>
		<p> Nexus wars. 24 hour hackathon where AI bots fought by creating formations and signaling to one another. Our team opted for a turtle strategy that focused primarily on mass expanding our units and only attacking as a defensive tool.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fade"> 
		<div class="project_names">  Simply Snap </div>
		<div class="project_date"> April 2018 </div>
		<p> Often times, students take notes using hand and paper. Our product explores the realm of computer vision to help students automotize transfering handwritten materials into a digital platform. All packed into a cleanly build user interface. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="fade"> 
		<div class="project_names">  Now This Is Podcasting </div>
		<div class="project_date"> March 2018 </div>
		<p> Hour long lectures and meetings can be hard to focus on and grasp the meaning of every topic discussed in the presentation. Often times, we miss little details or large sections in our notes and attention spans and need to refer back to online podcasts to refresh our memories. It's only after skipping around these hour-long recordings that we begin to develop a more complete understanding of the topic. Our product strives to remove this arduous and time consuming process by making podcast and video review both time efficient and effective.</p>

	<div class="fade"> 
		<div class="project_names">  MIT Battlecode 2018 </div>
		<div class="project_date"> Dec. 2018 - Feb. 2018 </div>
		<p> This year, Battlecode was set in an interplanetary battleground where two AI bots fought on the perishing planet Earth and the now more sustainable planet Mars. Our strategy was to create an organic way to mass expand our colonies on Earth, then create a turtle strategy until we could accumulate forces to travel to Mars. </p>

	<div class="fade"> 
		<div class="project_names">  Colored Bars and Toy Cars </div>
		<div class="project_date"> October 2018 </div>
		<p> We used AT&T's smart city API to create a data visualization platform where pedestrians and drivers can be better informed of their surrounding city. We also wanted to create an automated response system using Twilio's API to provide live updates of traffic and pedestrian conditions. To best demonstrate this, we created a couple simulations on Google Maps with custom markers and animated graphs. </p>

		<div class="position"> - Software Engineer Intern </div>
		<div class="project_date"> June 2018 - Sept. 2018 </div>
	</div>

	<div class="fade"> 
    	<p> Interned on the data reporting team, which analyzed company and user metrics data to help make informed business decisions. Worked on extracting, transforming, and loading a newly created dataset and helped create multiple autonomous scripts to enhance parts of the current workflow. Mainly learned how to utilize languages: PySpark, Python, and SQL. Developed backend and frontend skills using Scala and AngularJS during an intern-wide project. </p>

		<div class="project_names"> Treobytes </div>
		<div class="position"> - Facilitator </div>
		<div class="project_date"> Sept. 2017 - June 2018 </div>
	</div>

	<div class="fade"> 
    	<p> Over the course of a year, taught K-12 students in underprivileged areas skills in Scratch, TinkerCAD, and SonicPi. Each session would involve 1 hour sessions developing a certain skill in each of the respective technologies. Usually this would include a fun task, such as learning how to model a 3D boat in TinkerCAD, then testing that model the following week - or completing a challenge game in Scratch. I wanted to teach these kids to help empower them with creative problem solving skills and introduce them to technology that would otherwise be easily accessible in these areas. While teaching, I learned valuable speaking skills as well as how to properly convey high level topics in a simple and concise way such that a 2nd to 8th grader could understand. </p>
