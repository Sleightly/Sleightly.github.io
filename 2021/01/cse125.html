                                <h3>1. Meet up often</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This might seem like an absolute no-brainer, but it is an incredibly important
                                    starting step that jumpstarted many teams, especially when the course was remote. 
                                    According to a Google research study conducted on +180 active teams at Google, the
                                    top 2 factors that contribute to a team's success are psychological safety &
                                    dependability. If you're curious about what makes teams successful, I would highly
                                    recommend reading the study to learn more!
                                    Just to summarize, each member on the team should feel comfortable sharing new ideas
                                    to the team and asking each other for help. Team members should also be able to
                                    trust in each other to complete their deliverables. 
                                    From my experiences, I found that meeting up with my team, especially outside of
                                    course/development hours, helped bring everyone on the team closer together. Many
                                    times, my team would get lunch in Price Center, study in the CSE dungeons, play
                                    online games, and attend school events together. We had even planned a group DMV
                                    trip to register for our Real IDs; a trip that unfortunately ended up taking over 6
                                    hours because I managed to lock myself out of my own car (and according to my team,
                                    I'll never live this down). Our team had a lot of face-to-face interactions that
                                    bonded each of the team members closer together.
                                    Since I was able to get to closer to my team, bouncing new ideas, proposing last
                                    minute changes, and even simply asking for help was easy to do. Everyone on the team
                                    felt connected with one another and on the same page. 
                                    In a remote setting, it might be a bit more difficult to get this same level of
                                    cohesion within the team. I would recommend setting up a reoccurring team lunch just
                                    to hang out and chitchat, play some online games together, and consider even setting
                                    up a Discord server for the team.

                                <p>
                                    One of my favorite aspects of CSE 125 is that each team has the freedom to design
                                    any game they would like - under the constraints that they are able to build the
                                    game within 10 weeks. In the past years, teams have built their own versions of
                                    first person shooters, tower defense games, battle arena games, boss battle games,
                                    games with imbalanced teams, games with a building stage and then a fighting stage…
                                    the list goes on and on. 
                                    Reference existing games
                                    Many teams like to reference mechanics from existing games as starting point for
                                    designing their own games. Looking at the games from 2020, Cyber City was a
                                    cyberpunk, tower defense, battle arena game that had a similar minion and turret
                                    system based off of League of Legends. Grow Away, a plant-based, tower defense game,
                                    took concepts from Plants vs. Zombies, OverCooked, and Bloons Tower Defense.
                                    Create something new
                                    Another popular path is to come up with a new mechanics and use these mechanics as a
                                    focal point for the game. Gaia was a game that had a fairly simple graphics but a
                                    unique terrain manipulation feature. Each team consisted of 2 players, one player
                                    controlling a sphere that can roll around and collect coins, and another player that
                                    could raise and lower mountains to help their sphere traverse the terrain easier or
                                    block the other team's sphere. 
                                    There are very little restrictions on what type of game your team can build. I would
                                    highly recommend blue-skying some potential game ideas and later discussing these
                                    ideas with the professor and TA.

                                <p>
                                    One unique aspect of CSE 125 compared to other CSE courses is that the class is very
                                    unstructured. There aren't reoccurring lectures that you need to go to or bi-weekly
                                    homework that you need to submit. Therefore all of the teams decisions, planning,
                                    and deadlines are established by the team as well. 
                                    To ensure your team understands what needs to be done each week, I would highly
                                    recommend that your team invests a bit of time get week into a project management.
                                    During this weekly meeting, teammates can discuss what they have worked on so far,
                                    the tasks that they need to finish by next weeks meeting, and if there are any
                                    blockers in their way. Having a project management board can also serve to keep a
                                    general timeline of the project and see what is left to be done.
