                                    Reflecting on CSE 125, both as a student and as a TA, I have to admit that this was
                                    by far my favorite course to take here at UCSD. I enjoyed all of it: from blue
                                    skying new game designs and features with my fellow
                                    teammates to staying up late in the labs ordering McDonald's food delivery to
                                    remotely testing out games on the demo machines this past Spring.
                                </p>

                                    I felt like CSE 125 is a lot like climbing a mountain. The road might be tough. The
                                    summit might be misty. And you might stumble. But with incremental steps and a
                                    supportive team, you will slowly reach the top. And don't worry, there are also
                                    plenty of teams who have summited their own mountains! Before starting your own
                                    trek,
                                    I would highly recommend
                                    taking some time to learn about their journeys and seeing how they navigated their
                                    mountains.

                                    With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found that many of my normal day
                                    activities were taken for granted. Waving hi to my friends in
                                    the CSE dungeons. Setting up in-person team meetings by the benches in front of
                                    Burger King. Now much of our lives are filled more Zoom
                                    meetings with cameras turned off and less face-to-face interactions.

                                    As a past student and TA for the course during the start of the pandemic, I've laid
                                    out 4 helpful takeaways and tips that I believe will help teams climb the CSE 125
                                    mountain, Mt. CSE 125, especially in a remote environment.

                                    This might seem like an absolute no-brainer, but it is a simple starting step that
                                    can get lost in a remote setting.

                                    According to a <a

                                    +180 active teams, the top 2 factors that contribute to a team's success
                                    are psychological safety & dependability.
                                    This means each member on the team would feel comfortable sharing new ideas
                                    to the team and asking each other for help. Team members should also be able to
                                    trust in each other to complete their deliverables.

                                    From my experiences, I found that meeting up with my team, especially outside of
                                    course/development hours, helped bring everyone on the team closer together.
                                    Many
                                    times, my team would get lunch in Price Center, study in the CSE dungeons, play
                                    online games, and attend school events together. We had even planned a group DMV
                                    trip to register for our Real IDs; a trip that unfortunately ended up taking
                                    over 6
                                    hours because I managed to lock myself out of my own car (and according to my
                                    team,
                                    I'll never live this down). Our team had a lot of face-to-face interactions that
                                    bonded each of the team members closer together.

                                    Since I was able to get to closer to my team, bouncing new ideas, proposing last
                                    minute changes, and even simply asking for help was easy to do. Everyone on the
                                    team felt connected with one another and on the same page.

                                    In a remote setting, it might be a bit more difficult to get this same level of
                                    cohesion within the team. I would recommend setting up a reoccurring team lunch
                                    just to hang out and chitchat, play some online games together, and consider
                                    even
                                    setting up a <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"
                                        style="color:#ffffff">Discord</a> server for the team. These events and
                                    meet-ups
                                    will serve as a great introduction to see what types of games your teammates

                                <h2>2. Project Management</h2>
                                <p>
                                    One unique aspect of CSE 125 compared to other CSE courses is that the class
                                    structure is dependent on the team.

                                    There aren't any lectures that you need to attend --with
                                    the caveat of some amazing guest lectures-- or bi-weekly homework that you need to
                                    submit.

                                    Therefore all of the team's deadlines, design decisions, and productivity
                                    hours are established solely by the team. 

                                    To ensure your team understands what needs to be done each week, I
                                    recommend that your team invests in a project management tool and have a regular
                                    project planning session.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For each project planning session, there are 3 main questions that need to be
                                    answered.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1. What have you done this week?</li>
                                    <li>2. What are you planning on accomplishing by next week?</li>
                                    <li>3. Are there any blockers?</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <h3 style="text-align: center;">
                                    Focus on working code <br>
                                    . . .
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Given the time constraint of 10 weeks to build a fully functioning 3D multiplayer
                                    video game, it is important to focus on rolling out a
                                    <b><em>working product</em></b> than having the <em>cleanest system design</em>.

                                    Having productive project planning sessions will help keep the team's focus on the
                                    end goal while simultaneously laying out the steps needed to climb this mountain.

                                    Yes, I am talking about pair programming... but not exactly in the same sense as the
                                    traditional definition. With the lack of face-to-face interactions, it is often
                                    times hard to discuss game ideas and let the creativity flow between team members.
                                    It is also hard to get help and resolve blockers when there's a waiting time
                                    involved. In 2020, many of the teams would typically hop on a Zoom or Discord call
                                    and code together. They may not be exactly working on the same piece of code, but it
                                    is always nice to work in a more lively environment and have some friends to bounce
                                    ideas off of.

                                        which basically changes the VSCode editor into a Google doc. One user can open
                                        up a VSCode Live Share session and share their session link with their
                                        teammates. After joining, each member can work within the <i>same</i> code
                                        editor at the same time. I found this feature to be very useful for remote
                                        development and debugging sessions.

                                    One of my favorite aspects of CSE 125 is that each team has the freedom to
                                    climb any mountain they want. In other words, teams can design
                                    any game they would like - under the constraints that they are able to build the
                                    game within 10 weeks. In the past years, teams have built their own versions of
                                    first person shooters, tower defense games, battle arena games, boss battle
                                    games, games with imbalanced teams, games with a building stage and then a fighting
                                    stage… the list goes on and on. <b><em>There are a few running motifs that appear

                                    Many teams like to reference mechanics from existing games as starting point for
                                    designing their own games. Looking at the games from 2020,

                                    player that could raise and lower mountains to help their sphere traverse the
                                    terrain easier or block the other team's sphere.

                                    build, there always seems to exist some unforeseen force that tries to mess things
                                    up. Some unknown bug in the animation code. Some deadlock in server causing the game
                                    to crash. Overestimating the time it takes to finish a task. For this course, I
                                    would recommend striving for having a simple minimum viable product and leaving open
                                    ends to incorporate additional game features!
