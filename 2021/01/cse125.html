                                            large, complex software system in large groups. . . To make the class

                                    Reflecting on CSE 125, both as a student and as a TA, I have to admit that this was
                                    by far my favorite course to take here at University of California, San Diego. I
                                    enjoyed all of it: from blue skying new game designs and features with my fellow
                                    teammates to staying up late in the labs ordering McDonald's food delivery to
                                    remotely running student games on the demo machines this past Spring.
                                </p>

                                    I felt like CSE 125 is a lot like climbing a mountain. The road might be tough. The
                                    summit might be misty. And you might stumble. But with incremental steps and a
                                    supportive team, you will slowly reach the top. And don't worry, there are also
                                    plenty of teams who have summited their own mountains! I would highly recommend
                                    taking some time to learn about their journey and seeing how they navigated their
                                    mountains before starting your own trek.

                                    With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found many of my normal day activities
                                    were taken for granted. Waving hi to my friends in the CSE dungeons. Setting up
                                    in-person team meetings by the benches in front of Burger King. Going to DMV with my
                                    team so we could all get our real IDs, and somehow locking myself out of the car
                                    (oops). Now our lives filled with less face-to-face interactions and more Zoom
                                    meetings with cameras turned off.

                                    As a past student and TA for the course during the start of the pandemic, I've laid
                                    out 4 helpful takeaways and tips that I believe will help teams climb the CSE 125
                                    mountain, especially in a remote environment.

                                    This might seem like an absolute no-brainer, but it is a simple starting step that
                                    can get lost in a remote setting.

                                    According to a <a

                                    +180 active teams, the top 2 factors that contribute to a team's success
                                    are psychological safety & dependability.
                                    This means each member on the team would feel comfortable sharing new ideas
                                    to the team and asking each other for help. Team members should also be able to
                                    trust in each other to complete their deliverables.

                                    From my experiences, I found that meeting up with my team, especially outside of
                                    course/development hours, helped bring everyone on the team closer together.
                                    Many
                                    times, my team would get lunch in Price Center, study in the CSE dungeons, play
                                    online games, and attend school events together. We had even planned a group DMV
                                    trip to register for our Real IDs; a trip that unfortunately ended up taking
                                    over 6
                                    hours because I managed to lock myself out of my own car (and according to my
                                    team,
                                    I'll never live this down). Our team had a lot of face-to-face interactions that
                                    bonded each of the team members closer together.

                                    Since I was able to get to closer to my team, bouncing new ideas, proposing last
                                    minute changes, and even simply asking for help was easy to do. Everyone on the
                                    team felt connected with one another and on the same page.

                                    In a remote setting, it might be a bit more difficult to get this same level of
                                    cohesion within the team. I would recommend setting up a reoccurring team lunch
                                    just to hang out and chitchat, play some online games together, and consider
                                    even
                                    setting up a <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"

                                    will serve as a great introduction to see what types of games your teammates

                                <p>
                                    One unique aspect of CSE 125 compared to other CSE courses is that the class
                                    structure is dependent on the team.

                                    There aren't any lectures that you need to attend --with
                                    the caveat of some amazing guest lectures-- or bi-weekly homework that you need to
                                    submit.

                                    Therefore all of the team's deadlines, design decisions, and productivity
                                    hours are established solely by the team. 

                                    To ensure your team understands what needs to be done each week, I
                                    recommend that your team invests in a project management tool and have a regular
                                    project planning session.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For each project planning session, there are 3 main questions that need to be
                                    answered.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1. What have you done this week?</li>
                                    <li>2. What are you planning on accomplishing by next week?</li>
                                    <li>3. Are there any blockers?</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <h3 style="text-align: center;">

                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Given the time constraint of 10 weeks to build a fully functioning 3D multiplayer
                                    video game, it is important to focus on rolling out a
                                    <b><em>working product</em></b> than having the <em>cleanest system design</em>.

                                    Having productive project planning sessions will help keep the team's focus on the
                                    end goal while simultaneously laying out the steps needed to climb this mountain.

                                    One of my favorite aspects of CSE 125 is that each team has the freedom to
                                    climb any mountain they want. In other words, teams can design
                                    any game they would like - under the constraints that they are able to build the
                                    game within 10 weeks. In the past years, teams have built their own versions of
                                    first person shooters, tower defense games, battle arena games, boss battle
                                    games, games with imbalanced teams, games with a building stage and then a fighting
                                    stage… the list goes on and on. There are a few running motifs that appear when
                                    designing games.

                                    designing their own games. Looking at the games from 2020, Cyber City was a
                                    cyberpunk, tower defense, battle arena game that had a similar minion and turret
                                    system based off of League of Legends. Grow Away, a plant-based, tower defense
                                    game,
                                    took concepts from Plants vs. Zombies, OverCooked, and Bloons Tower Defense.

                                    Another popular path is to come up with a new mechanics and use these mechanics
                                    as a
                                    focal point for the game. Gaia was a game that had a fairly simple graphics but
                                    a
                                    unique terrain manipulation feature. Each team consisted of 2 players, one
                                    player
                                    controlling a sphere that can roll around and collect coins, and another player
                                    that
                                    could raise and lower mountains to help their sphere traverse the terrain easier
                                    or
                                    block the other team's sphere. 
                                    There are very little restrictions on what type of game your team can build.

                                    Looking back, CSE 125 seemed like a monumental mountain to climb, but each step
                                    along the way was very rewarding. The journey will be well worth the effort. And
                                    with that...
